				The Multimedia Programming and Design Program prepares students for careers in a variety of "multimedia
				industries", companies and institutions that develop, produce or market multimedia products, programs or services.
				The program instructs students in the design and programming of computer-based interactive products that
				incorporate text, graphics, sound,animation and video. It also develops different types of talent, both creative and
				technical,with the imperative that each understands the work of the other so that they can collaborate effectively.
				Students must complete a specialization in multimedia programming, art and design or video production in addition
				to the general and core requirements.</p>
